# Drum-Kit-Project

This project is from Angela Yu/App Brewery's 'Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp'.


In this quick project I utilized:
* DOM Selectors
* Event Listeners
* Audio Objects
* Switch Statements


I also learned more about:
* Constructor Functions
* Callbacks and Responding to Events
* Objects, their Methods, and the dot notation
